1. Modify the hello.py program to say hello to a historical political leader (or to Ada Lovelace). 
2. Change the program so that after the greeting, it asks, "How did you get here?". 
3. Re-write the original program to use two print statements: one for "Hello" and one for "world". The program should still only print out on one line.
