22. Create a Car Class with the following:
- a way to initialise the speed and heading attributes
- the heading attribute determines the direction in which the car is heading in degrees
- a way to accelerate the vehicle by accepting an increment argument that increases the speed
- a way for the car to brake (setting the speed to 0)
- a way to turn the direction in which the car is heading by accepting an angle argument
    - NB: angles should not be greater than 360 or less than 0 degrees
- a warning should be displayed when the car exceeds the maximum speed (120)
