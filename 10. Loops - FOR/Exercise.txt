20. Improve on the guessing game that tests the input of a user against any value set to x. 
    - If the guess is correct, print "Correct" to the screen. 
    - If the guess is incorrect print whether the guess was higher or lower than the value to the screen. 
    - Incorrect attempts should prompt the user to guess again
    - The game should end on a correct attempt or when the user inputs the string "quit"
    - The game should also limit to 5 attempts. Print the number of remaining attempts each time
